# Exception handling exercise with Python
Given the values div, nondiv, from, and to, a Python program
which finds the numbers between from and to (both included) that are divisible by div but
are not a multiple of nondiv, and then compares the obtained result with a list of numbers
given for comparison.
## Goal
The goal is that the program wonâ€™t
go "KABOOM" no matter what happens with the input.
